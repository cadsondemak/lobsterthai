# Lobster Thai Font

Lobster is a popular Latin and Cyrillic typeface, designed by Pablo Impallari. Here extended into Thai with an informal loopless design.

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

There is a specific approach on how to deal with thick and thin stroke for Thai glyphs. In order to develop Thai fonts, it is encouraged to take this font as an example for such method and other developments.

Informal loopless Thai tyefaces are simplified from a conservative looped Thai so this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character of each glyph.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

Ttfautohint supports Thai hinting process efficiently. It is an easy-to-use tool that is highly recommended. For more information, visit http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/

Glyphs files (.glyphs) in the source folder can be opened in Glyphs program for further development.
Font files (.ttf and .otf) in the fonts folder are compatible with Window, MacOS, and Linux system.

The Lobster Thai project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand. To contribute, see github.com/cadsondemak/lobsterthai
