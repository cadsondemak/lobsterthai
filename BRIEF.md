#Lobster Thai Font

This Thai typeface based on Lobster, one of the most popular typeface. The original Lobster designed by Pablo Impallari. Lobster Thai is the Thai version which includes Latin and supports all variations of the Thai script. The objective of this project is to design Thai glyphs that is compatible with Latin. However, leading has to be adjusted in order to support a level of Thai vowels and tone marks.
